git commands
git clone - creates a copy of a repo on your machine locally
git status - shows if the local repo is up to date with the copy that is uploaded to github
git add - stages files so they are ready to be committed to the local repo
git commit -m - commits the changes and allows you to add a descriptive changelog
git push - finally uploads the changes to github, syncing your copy and the github copy
